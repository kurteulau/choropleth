# Choropleth Tutorial

![alt text](choropleth-static-image.png 'Static map image')

The webpage was created using the US population density tutorial on [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). I've made a few changes in the visualization with the hope that the viewer will better understand the embedded data. I've also factored out all custom styles into stylesheet.css to make index.html more concise.

You can check out the tutorial here:

As noted in the links above, shout out to [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) for curating the data.

Next step: include data from most recent census since data used in this project is from 2011.
