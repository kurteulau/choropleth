# Choropleth Tutorial

![alt text](choropleth-static-image.png 'Static map image')

The webpage was created using the US population density tutorial on [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). I've made a few changes with the hope better ensuring the viewer will better understand the data embedded in the map.

You can check out the tutorial here:
* [Tutorial Part 1](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-1/)
* [Tutorial Part 2](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-2/)

As noted in the links above, shout out to [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) for curating the data.

Next step: include data from most recent census since data used in this project is from 2011.
